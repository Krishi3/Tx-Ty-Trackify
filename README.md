Tx-Fy Trackify

An application that helps you easily do your attendance while ensuring enough time for class productivity. All it takes is a simple input of the action you want to complete whether it is adding, removing, marking students present or exiting the program. You can then enter student details in order to execute the actions. When marking a student present, a camera will appear during the process in which a student will be detected and hence, marked present!
